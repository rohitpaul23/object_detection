# object_detection

This repository contains 7 files each working on object detection and localization
Files are:
1. imageProcess : Extract a dog image and put it inside another image
2. cifarResNet : Use ResNet50 to classify CIFAR datasets
3. MNISTdetection : CNN to classify and localize the main object in the image by drawing bounding box for MNIST dataset
4. objLocalization : Creating model for object localization
5. myModelDetection : Object detection using fine tuned model
6. objDetectModel : Single object detection using tensorflow hub
7. MultiObjectDetectAPI : Multiple object detection using API (tensorflow hub Inception ResNet v2)

** Projects are made taking help from deeplearning.ai course 'TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization'
